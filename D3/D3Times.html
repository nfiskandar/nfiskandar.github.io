          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Strong evidence linking income and health suggests that policies promoting economic equity may have broad health effects.
            Income influences health and longevity through various clinical, behavioral, social, and 
            environmental mechanisms. Isolating the unique contribution of income to health can be difficult 
            because this relationship intersects with many other social risk factors.</p>

          <p>Poor health also contributes to reduced income, creating a negative feedback loop sometimes referred to 
            as the health-poverty trap. Income inequality has grown substantially in recent decades, which may perpetuate or 
            exacerbate health disparities.</p>

          <p>Policy initiatives that supplement income and improve educational opportunities, housing prospects, 
            and social mobility—particularly in childhood—can reduce poverty
            and lead to downstream health effects not only for low-income people but also for those in the middle class.</p>
